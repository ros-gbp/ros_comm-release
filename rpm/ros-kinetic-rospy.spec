%description
rospy is a pure Python client library for ROS. The rospy client API enables
Python programmers to quickly interface with ROS Topics, Services, and
Parameters. The design of rospy favors implementation speed (i.e. developer
time) over runtime performance so that algorithms can be quickly prototyped and
tested within ROS. It is also ideal for non-critical-path code, such as
configuration and initialization code. Many of the ROS tools are written in
rospy to take advantage of the type introspection capabilities. Many of the ROS
tools, such as rostopic and rosservice, are built on top of rospy.
