Description: Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with ROS topics at a meta level.
 None of the programs in this package actually know about the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these tools deal with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be applied to any ROS topic.
